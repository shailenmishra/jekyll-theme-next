Stephen King makes [a case](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/31/opinion/stephen-king-can-a-novelist-be-too-productive.html?ref=oembed) that to produce more writing should not be dismissed as compromising on quality. And as always the man is worth listening to: “No one in his or her right mind would argue that quantity guarantees quality, but to suggest that quantity *never* produces quality strikes me as snobbish, inane and demonstrably untrue.”
