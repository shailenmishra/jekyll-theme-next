[This post](http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=17573) from Language Log felt personal for couple of reasons: first, It mentions my alma mater (NC State), and the highly important works done by the sociolinguists there on language diversity and educating people on non-standard Englishes and their validity; second, as a non-standard English speaker and writer, struggle with language is constant and draining. But then an article like this reminds me that this is not a losing battle.
