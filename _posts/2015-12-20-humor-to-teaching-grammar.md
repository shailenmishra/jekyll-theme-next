[An article](http://www.edutopia.org/blog/use-humor-teach-your-students-about-careful-communication-maurice-elias) from Edutopia that talks of using humor to teach students mechanics of writing. The article gives examples of poorly written headlines that create faux pas or gaffes. It can get studentsâ€™ attention right away about the grammatical and semantic aspect of the sentence. And when trying to fix the sentence students can learn hands-on the abstract concepts of grammar.
