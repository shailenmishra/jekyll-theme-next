As the semester winds up and I am getting ready for the next semester’s classes, I also look forward to reading the students’ evaluation (with equal amount of anticipation and weariness). Bit of dread over what might have gone wrong. But then there is always exhilaration in finding some surprising result. As I have been thinking about the evaluation process for some time and how to make it more useful, I am glad to have found [this article](http://www.facultyfocus.com/articles/faculty-evaluation/cruel-student-comments-seven-ways-soothe-sting/). I feel bit better now knowing that I am not the only one who dreads negative feedback.
